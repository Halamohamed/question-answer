        Question: 'What do you understand by Artificial Intelligence?',
        Answer: 'Artificial intelligence is computer science technology that emphasizes creating intelligent machine that can mimic human behavior. Here Intelligent machines can be defined as the machine that can behave like a human'
        +'think like a human, and also capable of decision making. It is made up of two words, "Artificial" and "Intelligence," which means the "man-made thinking ability.'
        +' With artificial intelligence, we do not need to pre-program the machine to perform a task; instead, we can create a machine with the programmed algorithms, and it can work on its own.'
